The aim is to implement an object prioritization approach, where the robot is programmed to select and pick up objects from a given set based on assigned priorities. Each object is ranked according to its relative importance. Additionally, the objective includes optimizing the time taken and integrating a control signal into the existing MPC framework to effectively reach specific coordinates on the map.
